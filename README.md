## 👋 hello

This repository is a curated collection of links to various courses and resources about Artificial Intelligence (AI). Whether you're a beginner or an experienced learner, there's something here for everyone!

## 👀 looking for ideas

I am looking for a good free course on statistics, linear algebra, integrals and derivatives that could be a good mathematical training for people who want to start a career in ML. I look forward to hearing [your ideas](https://github.com/SkalskiP/courses/pulls)!
