## ðŸ‘‹ hello

This repository is a curated collection of links to various courses and resources about Artificial Intelligence (AI). Whether you're a beginner or an experienced learner, there's something here for everyone!

## ðŸš§ help us

English is not the only language in the world. Many people do not speak English. Many creators do not make content in English. Therefore, we want to create separate lists of resources that can help people who want to build ML knowledge and do not speak that language. French is the next language we want to support. Help us [build](https://github.com/SkalskiP/courses/discussions/22) a list of resources in French.
